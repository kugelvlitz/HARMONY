# Harmony

## What

HARMONY is personal project aimed at building a comprehensive python library containing

* Sort algorithms
* Pathfinding
* Design Patterns
* And more!

## But... why? ArenÂ´t there already many many libraries containing standard data structures?

Yes! And you probably should use those.

HARMONY's purpose is to make me review concepts that I may have forgotten over the years or not implemented at all before.

## Learn with me

If you're new to coding feel free to use this as a learning aid.

## Not done, yet

This is very much a work in proggress and I'll be updating it semi-regularly.
